Cocos2dx-Integer-read-from-Plist-file
=====================================

This module extracts integers(co-ordinates) from the plist file and maps them on the screen
Plist file are like files where data can be stored externally and at run time the data will be fetched.
It has advantages like changing the data at whim without involving into much codes.

In this Module this is to show how to fetch the Integers that work as co-ordinates for Sprites (X,Y) from the plist (property list)
file by converting CCString -> toInt.
